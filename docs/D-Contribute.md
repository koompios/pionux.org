For more details Talk to the maintainers for help coordinating major projects.
Help:Editing#Creating pages covers the steps to create a new article in the main namespace.

The wiki's subpage feature (article/subpage) is available for your userpage as well. Using it you could create the draft on a blank subpage. Please note that userpage content must not be categorized, but all other features can be used. Once you have finished drafting, you can simply move the subpage to its new name.

Please add relevant article status templates (only) after you moved it. The better you describe a status template's reason, the easier it is for users.

## Organizing

Sorting, categorizing, and moving articles around has become a major task for all wiki maintainers implementing and improving the category tree.

- Reduce and combine duplicate pages.
- Improve wiki navigation.
- Categorize uncategorized pages, uncategorized categories and wanted categories.
- Fix broken and double redirects. 


## Complaining
If you have any ***generic*** negative remarks or complaints about how the wiki is moderated or administered, please leave a message in Pionux talk:Maintenance Team. Of course it should not be necessary to state that it is indeed possible to complain about something using a civil and respectful tone :) For complaints regarding **specific** edits or articles, please use a more appropriate talk page.
