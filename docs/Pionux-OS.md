This is the documentation on how to install PionuxOS to your laptop or PC and the installation on Virtualbox. Dual boot is also available for Pionux.

> Note: The process of installation is different is you are using KramaOS (v1) which is the Pionux (v1) because it is Ubuntu based. Reminder that Pionux is Arch based.
