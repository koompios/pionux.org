Here is what are the thing you need to know about the OS. 

For the first time the a few decades, This OS has been born,which we called **KramaOS** or **KOSMOS**. It is an first experiment for **KOOMPI community users**. Those who have old laptops and lower specs hardware.

**KramaOS** is the first version of our operating system(OS). This version is based on Ubuntu Server with user interface customized of Budgie desktop and Brisk Menu.

Finally, now our team have created new possible OS, which is **PionuxOS** a fully customized and self-customizable Cambodia based open-source operating system software solution for up and coming engineers, inventors, organizers, developers and basically free thinkers in a modern-day post-Microsoft world.
