### Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.
### Process on how to update/add documentation
This way, we determine clearly what we are working on without stepping on each other's toes.
If there's something unclear to you please let me know or feedback on the process.

1.  Communicate with others what you want to write about by checking the "project under the description". This way, we will be avoiding merge conflict with each other’s branch.

2.  Create your working branch with a proper name of what you are currently working. Ideally forking the project. Trying to keep master stables and ready to go. Either way, it's now protected, meaning no push can push code directly without a PR.

3.  Create PR (Pull request). Try to make it small.
By having a PR, it is easier for contributors of this project to follow-up with each other’s task. Be clear about what you have changes in the PRs description, it will be easier in the future to have a history of the work. PRs will help each other’s for improvement and by giving comment to make the task done.

    *  MR. Rithy and others will be reviewing the PR by giving comments.
    *  Developer updates the PR based on the comments.
    *  Team review again. Once the PR is approved, the docs updated do not need to be touched until the team decides to. MR. Rithy will make the final call, put as required reviewer (minimum of 2, ideally one of them could be MR. Brilliant or MR. Rithy) for the PR.

>**Task**: Before starting a new task, check frequently the project board. This tools is a great way to check colleague work and not wasting time. If a contributor has an idea for documentation. Add it in the backlog items with proper description it will be addressed later.

It way seems difficult with practice, it will be easier.
