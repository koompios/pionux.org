#### Parted
Parted is a program for creating and manipulating partition tables. GParted is a GUI frontend.
In other to install it you must type this command in konsole:
```Text
    $ pi -S parted
```
Parted has two modes: command line and interactive. Parted should always be started with:
```
    # parted device
```
Where `device` is the hard disk device to edit (for example `/dev/sda`). If you omit the `device` argument, *parted* will attempt to guess which device you want.
**Note:**If you are't in root, use this:
```
    $ sudo bash
```

#### Command line mode for Parted
In command line mode, this is followed by one or more commands. For example:
```Text
    # parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt mkpart P1 ext3 1MiB 8MiB 
```
**Note:** Options (like `--help`) can only be specified on the command line.
#### Interactive mode for Parted
Interactive mode simplifies the partitioning process and reduces unnecessary repetition by automatically applying all partitioning commands to the specified device.

In order to start operating on a device, execute:
```Text
    # parted /dev/sdx
```
**Tips:**You will notice that the command-line prompt changes from a hash (`#`) to (`parted`): this also means that the new prompt is not a command to be manually entered when running the commands in the examples.
To see a list of the available commands, enter:
```Text
    (parted) help
```
When finished, or if wishing to implement a partition table or scheme for another device, exit from parted with:
```Text
    (parted) quit
```
After exiting, the command-line prompt will change back to `#`.

If you do not give a parameter to a command, Parted will prompt you for it. For example:
```Text
(parted) mklabel
New disk label type? gpt
```
#### Create new partition table
You need to (re)create the partition table of a device when it has never been partitioned before, or when you want to change the type of its partition table. Recreating the partition table of a device is also useful when the partition scheme needs to be restructured from scratch.

Open each device whose partition table must be (re)created with:
```Text
    # parted /dev/sdx
```
To then create a new **GUID Partition Table**, use the following command:
```
    (part) mklabel gpt
```
To create a new **Master Boot Record**/MS-DOS partition table instead, use:
```Text
    (parted) mklabel msdos
```
You can decide the number and size of the partitions the devices should be split into, and which directories will be used to mount the partitions in the installed system (also known as mount points).
The following command will be used to create partitions:
```Text
    $ (parted) mkpart part-type fs-type start end
```
- `part-type` is one of `primary`, `extended` or `logical`, and is meaningful only for MBR partition tables.
- `fs-type` is an identifier chosen among those listed by entering `help mkpart` as the closest match to the file system that you will use. The *mkpart* command does not actually create the file system: the `fs-type` parameter will simply be used by parted to set a 1-byte code that is used by boot loaders to "preview" what kind of data is found in the partition, and act accordingly if necessary.
- `start` is the beginning of the partition from the start of the device. It consists of a number followed by a **unit**, for example `1MiB` means start at 1 MiB.
- `end` is the end of the partition from the start of the device (not from the start value). It has the same syntax as `start`, for example `100%` means end at the end of the device (use all the remaining space).
>**Tip:** Most Open-Source native file systems map to the same MBR partition type code **{0x83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type#PID_83h)**, so it is perfectly safe to e.g. use ext2 for an ext4-formatted partition.

>**Warning:** It is important that the partitions do not overlap each other: if you do not want to leave unused space in the device, make sure that each partition starts where the previous one ends.

>**Note:** parted may issue a warning like:
```Text
    Warning: The resulting partition is not properly aligned for best performance.
    Ignore/Cancel?
```
The following command will be used to flag the partition that contains the /boot directory as bootable:
```Text
    (parted) set partition boot on
```
- `partition` is the number of the partition to be flagged (see the output of the `print` command).
- `esp` is an alias for `boot` on GPT.
Resizing partitions is used by this command:
```Text
    (parted) resizepart number end
```
##### Tips and tricks
###### Dual booting with Windows XP
If you have a Windows XP partition that you would like to move from drive-to-drive that also happens to be your boot partition, you can do so easily with GParted and keep Windows happy simply by deleting the following registry key PRIOR to the partition move:
```Text
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices
```

##### Troubleshooting
###### Video broken or other issue after upgrade
Now and then VLC will have some issues with configuration even in minor releases. Before making bug reports, remove or rename your configuration located at `~/.config/vlc` and confirm whether the issue is still there.

If using a ffmpeg variant from the AUR, be sure that you have upgraded it as well. Pacman will not upgrade it when necessary and a mismatch will break VLC.

###### Segmentation fault
If that does not work, VLC has a segfault issue with `plugins.dat`, simply remove the file:
```Text
    $ rm <Location of the file>
```
###### Missing icons in dropdown menus
This can happen under XFCE, there will be no more icons in dropdown menus, like the PCI card icon.

Execute these commands to reactivate these icons:
```Text
    $ gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/buttons_have_icons true
    $ gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons true
```
###### Failed to open VDPAU backend
Since your system probably does not support VDPAU you should tell VLC to use VA-API instead, see [#Hardware video acceleration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VLC_media_player#Hardware_video_acceleration).
###### No playback via SFTP of media files names containing spaces
If VLC does not play any videos or audio files over SFTP make sure you have **sshfs** installed.

If it refuses to play any media files containing spaces via SFTP and always asks for authentication change the Exec line in the` vlc.desktop` file to:
```Text
    $ Exec=/usr/bin/vlc --started-from-file %F
```

#### VMware
